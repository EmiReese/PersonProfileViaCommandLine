# PersonProfileViaCommandLine

Description:
This is a simple command-line application that creates a person's work profile. I created this by using Inquirer prompts and file system.

How it works:
When a user opens up this application in the command-line, they are asked a series of questions. After they put in the answers, the answers are placed into the premade 'index.html' file to create a work profile. The index.html file will be automatically created by 'file systems'. After the file is created, the work profile can be opened and viewed in the browser.

Technologies used:
Node, Inquirer and fs
